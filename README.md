# Objective and Ideative Expansion
This JavaScript script offers automated Instagram follower engagement, bypassing restrictions on traditional bots. It enables automated following to boost your follower count organically and efficiently.

In addition to the Instagram automation script, this repository includes several technical demonstrations: 

# 1. Scheduled Automation Module (Python using schedule library)
This Python script demonstrates how to schedule tasks to run at specified intervals using the schedule library. It can be used for automating recurring actions efficiently.

# 2. Auto-comment and Auto-like Module (Python for Instagram Automation)
This Python script illustrates how to interact with Instagram programmatically to automate actions such as liking and commenting on posts. It provides a practical example of automating social media engagement.

# 3. Data Analytics Module (Python with Pandas and Matplotlib)
In this demonstration, you'll find Python code that showcases data analysis and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib. The primary focus will lie on handling and visualizing data.

# 4. User Authentication Module (Python with Flask)
The included Python code demonstrates a Flask-based user authentication system, a fundamental aspect of web application development. Aimed at building secure and user-friendly web applications.

Feel free to explore, customize, and expand upon these demonstrations. Specific configurations and data to personalize each example are being worked upon.. :) 

These technical demonstrations and the Instagram automation script form this Project portfolio.

## Usage: 
Utilize this code for both the suggested page and other users' follower's dialogue box, employing it in a technically succinct manner.

### In the main "Suggested Page":

* Navigate to the URL: https://www.instagram.com/explore/people/suggested/

* Access the browser's developer tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect." In the developer tools console, copy and paste the entire code.

* Ensure that the argument provided within the FunctionMain("suggested") function call is set to "suggested."

* Verify that the final line of the code resembles the following format.
```
FunctionMain("suggested");
```

### In Other People's Followers Dialog Box: 

* Navigate to a webpage analogous to your Instagram profile, and subsequently, click on the "Followers" button, prompting a pop-up dialog box to appear.
  
* In the browser's developer tools, access the console by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect."
  
* Within the developer tools console, proceed to copy and paste the entirety of the provided code.
  
* Ensure that the argument passed within the FunctionMain("othersfollowers") function call is explicitly set to "othersfollowers" and confirm that the final line of the code adheres to the following specified format.
```
FunctionMain("othersfollowers");
```

Execute the code by copying and pasting it into the console, then press "Enter." Keep the tab open, and it will autonomously initiate the process of following other users. If any issues arise, please promptly report them.
