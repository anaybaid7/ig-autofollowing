# Project Name: ig-autofollowing
A JavaScript-based Instagram automation script for targeted follower engagement, featuring dynamic scrolling and automated following.

# Objective and Ideative Expansion
This JavaScript script offers automated Instagram follower engagement, bypassing restrictions on traditional bots. It enables automated following to boost your follower count organically and efficiently.

In addition to the Instagram automation script, this repository includes several technical demonstrations: 

# 1. Scheduled Automation Module (Python using schedule library)
This Python script demonstrates how to schedule tasks to run at specified intervals using the schedule library. Can be used for automating recurring actions efficiently.

# 2. Auto-comment and Auto-like Module (Python for Instagram Automation)
This Python script illustrates how to interact with Instagram programmatically to automate actions such as liking and commenting on posts. It provides a practical example of automating social media engagement.

# 3. Data Analytics Module (Python with Pandas and Matplotlib)
In this demonstration, you'll find Python code that showcases data analysis and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib. The primary focus will lie on handling and visualizing data.

# 4. User Authentication Module (Python with Flask)
The included Python code demonstrates a Flask-based user authentication system, a fundamental aspect of web application development. Aimed at building secure and user-friendly web applications.

Feel free to explore, customize, and expand upon these demonstrations. Specific configurations and data to personalize each example are being worked upon.. :) 

These technical demonstrations, coupled with the Instagram automation script form this Project portfolio.
